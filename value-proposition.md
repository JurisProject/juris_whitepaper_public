## Value Proposition

_We are not building a full featured consumer facing dApp. We are building a pick-and-shovel tool that nearly every consumer-facing dApp will need.  _

### Value to Decentralized App \(dApp\) Publishers_ _

Dispute resolution is not the core focus of any dApp publisher, but is a vital component of dApp functionality, especially when tokens are changing hands in the case of e-commerce, freelancing, crowdfunding, or financial securities. Transaction disputes can be a sincere source of legal liability and thus existential risk for a fledgling application. By integrating Juris as their default dispute resolution mechanism, publishers can offload this risk -- for free.

### Value to Contract Parties & Developers

The Juris platform will provide Protocol users to add a layer of human-based risk mitigation to their smart contracts at minimal expense. Developers will be able to make JRS by contributing to the open source protocol.

### Value to Jurists

Jurist will be able to monetize adjudication experience and legal knowledge. They are the users that make our judgement system run. Any one can become a Jurist, and earn JRS by doing so. Users with legal training will have a head start on other Jurists, but the ultimate measure of a Jurist's quality is the platform's **reputation score**. The reputation score is calculated using machine learning and graph analysis \(like google's pagerank.\) This score ranks Jurists using their implicit, and explicit, endorsements of one another, which are generated through the normal activity of producing judgements. Being able to prove their good judgement, by advertising their Jurist rep-score, may prove to be more valuable to jurists than the JRS they can earn.
