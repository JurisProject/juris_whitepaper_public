## Introduction

### Calamity on the Blockchain

In May 2016, the DAO, or “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” launched the largest crowdfunding campaign in history.[^1] Not just on the Ethereum Blockchain -- but **ever**. They raised 150 million dollars worth of Ether by the end of 28 days. But, their success was short lived: on June 17th, 2016, we saw what happens when the intention behind a “Smart Contract” diverges from its codified implementation. Several errors inside the smart contract code written by the DAO team allowed a single bad actor to drain 50 million dollars worth of Ether from the DAO wallets overnight. The remainder of the funds were saved only because a group of “white hat” hackers moved them to a friendly wallet via the same exploit.

The breach was significant enough to drastically undermine investor confidence in Ether. Immediately following the DAO's theft, Ether's price cratered and lost nearly 63% of its value. Beyond just a price drop, the impact of the DAO was forceful enough to crack Ethereum into two entire separate blockchains: Ethereum, on which the DAO transactions were erased, and Ethereum Classic, where they were not. The split took place because this "hack" wasn't strictly illegal, or even really a hack. These bad actors didn't break anything; they noticed errors and exploited them to make the contract function in a way other than intended. The community was split on how to handle this: should they stick to the "four corners" of the contract terms, or stick to the intent of the smart contract code? After much debate there was a "Hard Fork" of the Ethereum Blockchain[^2]. The fork happened because the Ethereum Foundation decided to honor the intent of the contract over the literal code written. This type of dispute is not new. **This is contract law.**

Had the set of smart contracts that constituted the DAO been constructed with an adjudication platform available as insurance \(in the way court systems safeguard ink and paper contracts\) the events that unfolded, ranging from the loss of market cap to the “Hard Fork” of Ethereum, may have been preventable. It is to avoid catastrophes like these, and engender a better confidence in smart contracts at large, that we propose **Juris**: a decentralized adjudication platform for blockchain smart contracts.

### The Juris Mission

* To make “smart contracts” on all blockchains safe, robust, and human.  
* To create a protocol, token, and reputation system for fair dispute resolution, justice, and judgement.  
* To make justice as efficient, effective, and accessible as the Internet.
