# System Attack Resistance

#### Sybil Attack

The reputation algorithm and Repchain will make it very expensive to produce high ranked Jurists without providing value to the network. That value creates a prohibitive cost for the creation of a new users \(in good standing\) which makes a Sybil attack on the Juris protocol itself extremely difficult. \(See [Reputation Blockchains Section](/reputation.md) for more on Repchain sybil attack resistance.\)

#### 50%+1 Attack

On top of the mechanisms that make a 51% attack difficult on any blockchain platform, the bicameral structure of Juris Foundation governance will make Juris much more resistant to a 51% attack. Even if someone could control a super majority of Juris Proof of Stake they would be blocked by the Proof of Judgment chamber from forcing any changes to the Foundation Contract.
