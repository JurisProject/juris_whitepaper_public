## The Juris Token \(JRS\)

The Juris Protocol will use a proprietary blockchain based token \(JRS\) to incentivize developers and Jurists to be involved and improve the system. The use of this "tokenization" of resources allows us to provide the Protocol as an open source project. But with the boom of ICOs and tokenized projects, it is worth addressing the relevance of JRS in detail.

#### Compatibility

As a Judicial Protocol, and a Judicial Platform the goal of Juris is to establish a consistency of justice and fair dispute resolution across any smart contract platform or any decentralized agreement-based systems that may come in the future. To make this happen, we will need to create an incentive system that is, in essence, portable. The need to calibrate pricing and convert in and out of native currencies for each blockchain will make the inclusion of the Juris CDK unduly complex.

#### Affordability

Access to fair dispute resolution is too important to fluctuate wildly at the whim of a volatile market. As the blockchain community has seen most recently with Bitcoin, the global cryptocurrency market is massively volatile. Using our own token will allows us to avoid usability and access issues potentially created by this volatility. A sudden increase in BTC or ETH price cannot create a situation where the pursuit of justice is affordable one day, and too expensive the next. The creation of an economy of JRS to support the protocol will allow the foundation greater control over token allocation policy.  Additionally, the creation of a proprietary economy will allow the foundation to employ a more diverse set of economic incentives and controls to cushion against cryptocurrency market volatility and promote developer involvement.

#### Jurist Selection & Governance

JRS is not only an incentive mechanism, but also a fundament part of the system itself. Invitations to take part in SNAP judgements as a Jurist are open to all JRS holders worldwide. This ensures a wide Jurist pool, and the involvement of only those users with a stake in the protocol. Additionally, this same staking function will be relevant as foundation governance evolves to a "Proof of Stake" model for community input on protocol development and evolution.

#### Clarity

In the context of justice and dispute resolution clarity is important. The ability to quickly recognize that a contract is or isn't protected by the Juris Protocol is vital to its usability. If the CDK is included, and there is JRS attached to the contract, then the Juris Protocol is active, and the smart contract is protected. If there is no JRS, the CDK is not active. In this case, the use of a native token \(presumably the same token used as currency on the chain in question\) would create a potentially confusing need to segregate currency involved as part of the transaction from identical native currency set aside to "sign" the Juris CDK. This lack of clarity could result not only in user or contract code mishaps, but could result in legal confusion as to whether or not the CDK arbitration clause was ultimately agreed upon by both parties.
