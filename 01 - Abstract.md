Contract disputes occur. **Off the blockchain**, we resolve them through the court system or a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution \(ADR\). The more structured form of ADR, called “arbitration,” involves the airing of grievances before a panel of neutral jurists, who assess the facts and provide a decision. The power of arbitration is recognized internationally, with \~150 countries required by UN treaty to enforce arbitration judgements. In the United States neutral arbitration is a for-profit business. **On the blockchain**, there does not yet exist a protocol for the fair and efficient resolution of disputes in smart contracts. In this paper we introduce the **Juris Protocol**, an open source arbitration protocol built for the blockchain, and **Juris Token \(JRS\),** a utility token to facilitate and incentivize Juris platform activity. Through the use of Juris' Mediation Tools, Contract Development Kit \(CDK\), and Adjudication Protocol, the disputed outcome of any smart contract may be contested through United Nations compliant neutral arbitration. Additionally, the Juris Protocol introduces a novel reputation system based on prior certification, ongoing community activity, machine learning, and graph analysis. The protocol is intended to facilitate the inclusion of both professional human arbiters and a larger community of novices. In this paper we review Juris' improvements on the current state of the art, explore Juris as a framework, and describe a governance model for launch and future development. As a platform, Juris seeks to improve both the safety and security of smart contracts. This will reduce the risk in the transition of traditional transactions onto blockchain-based alternatives and, in turn, increase broad adoption of blockchain technology.
